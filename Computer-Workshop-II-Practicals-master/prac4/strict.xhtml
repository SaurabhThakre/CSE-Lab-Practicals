<h1>Solid Waste Management</h1>
	<h2>Types of Waste Disposal Method</h2>
		<h3>(I) Sanitary Landfilling<br />(II) Incineration<br />(III) Composting</h3>
<hr />
	<h4>Sanitary Lanfilling</h4>
<p><div>Landfilling Process</div>
1.) <span>Removal of Top Soil:</span>Formation of pit by removal of top soil<br />
2.) <span>Bottom Liner:</span>Made of synthetic plastic to prevent leakage of waste materials<br />
3.) <span>Waste Dumped and Compressed:</span>It is done with the helf of heavy machinary<br />
4.) <span>Waste water pipe:</span>It is use to collect liquid that oozes out after compression<br />
5.) <span>Methane Gas collection:</span>It is later used to generate heat and electricity<br />
6.) <span>Covered by clay and top soil:</span>It is covered by top soil prevent foul smell leakage</p>
<hr />

	<h4>Incineration</h4>
<p><div>Incineration Process</div>
1.) <span>Dumping of waste:</span>Waste is dumped in waste bunker<br />
2.) <span>Combustion:</span>Combustion of waste materials is carried out in furnance<br />
3.) <span>Generating electricity:</span>Steam produced in the boiler is used for generating<br />
4.) <span>Cooling flue gases:</span>Flue gases are colled in wet scrubber<br />
5.) <span>Cleaning flue gases:</span>Flue gases are then cleaned in electrostatic precipitator<br />
6.) <span>Releasing Smoke:</span>Smoke is then released through tall chimney</p>
<hr />

	<h4>Composting</h4>
<p><div>Composting Process</div>
1.) <span>Collection:</span>Biodegradable waste is collected from homes and restaurents<br />
2.) <span>Sorting:</span>Waste is sorted in two categories i.e. wether food or not<br />
3.) <span>In-vessel composting:</span>Composting takes place in barrier with 60^C temperature<br />
4.) <span>Open Windrow composting:</span>Composting takes place in open air<br />
5.) <span>Screening and grading:</span>Compost is then screened and graded in a barrel<br />
6.) <span>Compost:</span>Then compost is redy to sell in market</p>
