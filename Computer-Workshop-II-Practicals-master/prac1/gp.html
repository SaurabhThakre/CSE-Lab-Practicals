As of <cite>August 2018</cite>, the total population of the world exceeds 7.63 billion people, and this number is continuing to grow each day. However, in some areas, growth is slowing or even declining.

China is the most populous country in the world with a population exceeding 1.4 billion. It is one of just two countries with a population of more than 1 billion, with India being the second. As of 2018, India has a population of over 1.355 billion people. However, its growth is expected to continue through at least 2050. By the year 2030, the India is expected to become the most populous country in the world. This is because India’s population will grow, while China will see a loss in population.
<br>
The next 11 countries that are the most populous in the world each have populations exceeding 100 million. These include the United States, Indonesia, Brazil, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Russia, Mexico, Japan, Ethiopia and the Philippines. Of these nations, all are expected to continue to grow with the exception of Russia and Japan, which will see their populations drop by 2030 before dropping again significantly by 2050.
<br>
There are many other nations that have populations of at least one million, while there are also countries that have just thousands. The smallest population in the world can be found in Vatican City, where just 801 people reside.
<br>
In 2018, the world’s population grew at a rate of 1.12%. Every five years since the 1970s, the growth rate has continued to fall. The world’s population is expected to continue to grow larger, but at a much slower rate. By 2030, the population will exceed 8 billion. In 2040, this number will grow to more than 9 billion. In 2055, the number will rise to over 10 billion, and another billion people won’t be added until near the end of the century. The current annual population growth estimates from the United Nations are in the millions - estimating that over 80 million new lives are added each year.
<br>
This growth will be impacted greatly by nine specific countries which are situated to contribute to the population growth more quickly than other nations. These nations include the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Uganda, the United Republic of Tanzania, and the United States of America. Particularly of interest, India is on track to overtake China's position as the most populous country by the year 2030. Additionally, multiple nations within Africa are expected to fully double their populations before fertility rates begin to slow.
<br>
Global life expectancy has also improved in recent years, increasing the overall population life expectancy at birth to just over 70 years of age. The projected global life expectancy is only expected to continue to improve - reaching nearly 77 years of age by the year 2050. Important factors impacting the data on life expectancy include the projections of the ability to reduce AIDS/HIV impact, as well as reducing the rates of infectious and non-communicable diseases.
<br>
Population aging has a massive impact on the ability of the population to maintain what is called a support ratio. One key finding from 2017 is that the majority of the world is going to face considerable growth in the 60 plus age bracket. This will put enormous strain on the younger age groups as the elder population is becoming so vast without the number of births to maintain a healthy support ratio.
